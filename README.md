# APAC Website

The data will be stored in the folder "data", so you can just edit the contents in the folder.

* lazy key is for preloading the images before the big image.

**Don't change the key names**

## Adding Old Events

To add old events, head to Events.js in data folder, if it is in a new year, just add the year from the top,
and fill in the information according to the keys. (just copy one of the events and add it in).

## Changing Active Event

Edit the file "ActiveEvent.js":

If there isn't any active event, just change the active to false and vice versa.

The colors of the page can be changed easily in the color section of ActiveEvent

You can add multiple items to posts, all will be displayed out. The template of
writing an active event can be referred to the comments in ActiveEvent.js

## Committee Members

Edit the file Committees.js:

So far only linkedin, facebook, instagram, website and github social media websites but
not necessary to fill them all.

seq is for sequencing, e.g., president seq 1, vice-president seq 2... but
for normal committees can take same seq, it'll be sorted based on department,
then followed by name, so can take same sequence.

The other 2 are self-explanatory.
